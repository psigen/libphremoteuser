libphremoteuser
===============

This extension to [Phabricator](http://phabricator.org/) performs authentication 
via a web server's `REMOTE_USER` variable.  It should be able to work with a variety of 
major servers such as Apache and Nginx, but I have only tested it with Apache.

It can be used with Basic authentication, but is most useful when the server is
configured for single-sign-on, for example, using kerberos.

Installation
------------

To install this library, simply clone this repository alongside your phabricator installation:

    cd /path/to/install
    git clone https://github.com/make-all/libphremoteuser.git

Then, simply add the path to this library to your phabricator configuration:

    cd /path/to/install/phabricator
    ./bin/config set load-libraries '["libphremoteuser/src/"]'

When you next log into Phabricator as an Administrator, go to **Auth > Add Authentication Provider**.  
In the list, you should now see an entry called **Web Server**.  Enabling this provider should add a 
new button to your login screen.

In order to actually log in, your web server needs to populate the `$REMOTE_USER` variable when the
login button is pressed.  You can do this by forcing the login URI that Phabricator uses to be 
restricted, by adding a directive like the following to your web server configuration (this is Apache2):

    <Location "/auth/login/RemoteUser:self/">
      AuthType Kerberos
      AuthName "Phabricator at My Server"
	  KrbAuthRealms DOMAIN.EXAMPLE.COM
	  KrbServiceName HTTP
	  Krb5Keytab /etc/apache2/kerberos.keytab
	  KrbMethodNegotiate On
	  KrbMethodK5Passwd On
	  KrbLocalUserMapping On
	  
	  # The following two lines can be used when authenticating against
	  # Microsoft ActiveDirectory to pull extra info from LDAP, and
	  # limit access to a certain group.  It may also be useful in
	  # other cases.
	  # Require ldap-dn can probably be used to allow all users in
	  # a domain if you don't wish to limit access to a group, or
	  # multiple Require ldap-group lines can be used to expand the list.
	  # Require valid-user will bypass the LDAP authorization step,
	  # defeating the additional info on the first line
	  AuthLDAPUrl ldap://adserver.domain.example.com/dc=domain,dc=example,dc=com?uid,cn,mail
      Require ldap-group DEVELOPERS_GROUP
	  
      Options None
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
    </Location>


When a user registers using this auth provider, it will attempt to discover
the user's full name and email from `AUTHORIZE_CN` and `AUTHORIZE_MAIL` variables
in the server environment, as well as getting the username from `REMOTE_USER`.
These variables are available if you configure LDAP authorization with those
attributes appended to the `AuthLDAPUrl` directive, as explained in the
[mod_authnz_ldap](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html#exposed)
[documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html#authldapurl).

If you use LDAP for authentication rather than kerberos, the
environment variables will start with `AUTHENTICATE_` instead of `AUTHORIZE_`, but you are probably better off using
Phabricator's native LDAP auth provider in that case.


Security
--------

I make no guarantees about this library being totally secure.  It's not __obviously__ insecure.  
However, please make sure to at least 
**REDIRECT THE LOGIN URI TO SSL, OTHERWISE YOU ARE POTENTIALLY SENDING PLAIN TEXT PASSWORDS.**

If you care about security consider:
  * Hosting Phabricator entirely on https/SSL
  * Restricting access to the whole Phabricator installation directory, also using SSL.
